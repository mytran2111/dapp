# React Demo app

Clone the repository and launch the website on your local host on port 3000


 via:

```
npm run start
```

Once you launch the app, you will need to create Metamask Wallet and connect your wallet to your browser (https://metamask.io/)

Troubleshooting: you will need to put the mnemonic phrase to the .env file or store it as key in Amazon Key Manager, you will need to connect your localhost with Metamask.

If connected successfully, you will be able to see the your account detail in the app and you can now enter the token from Etherescan to buy and exchange token.
